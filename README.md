# Getting Started

This project is a React.js-driven app for the weather reports of the city of Thessaloniki, Greece.

It fetches its data from https://openweathermap.org/ and provides the current time weather report, as well as the forecast for the current day and the upcoming 7 ones.

A chart is also implemented to display the maximum temperatures of the upcoming days.

The project is built on React.js, using:
-create-react-app for initialization,
-Redux/toolkit for state management and data fetching,
-SASS for automated and nested styling.

To install this app, in the project directory run:

### `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
